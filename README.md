# Basic-Portfolio-Project-Using-Springboot-and-JavaFX
i have made a basic portfolio maker portal using javaFX as my front end and spring boot as backend code my user friendly project includes login, signup,authentication of user and database crud operations by sending http requests to the spring boot from JavaFX. i have rarely seen projects which are made using these two different domains of codes.
